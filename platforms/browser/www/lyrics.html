                          Oh your face is the same, but you've changed beneath your skin<br>
                          and that's more than you'll ever tell him</p>

                          <p>With all our torrid memories written down<br>
                          Old tomes on a bookshelf I could do without</p>

                          <p>It's been too long, and we're not friends anymore<br>
                          and it's hardly now a stretch to say I'm less bitter than before<br>
                          Well I've got time and I've got patience - I've got none that you deserve<br>
                          so bury all your expectations - any bridges built now are more for me to burn</p>

                          <p>Text says the first love is the hardest one<br>
                          and the worst part is that I'm to blame 'cause I couldn't stop the crush<br>
                          I was a kid then - I didn't know better; <br>
                          I'm still a kid now, just in newer clothes</p>

                          <p>With all our horrid memories writ and bound, now<br>
                          Old tomes on a bookshelf I could do without</p>

                          <p>Tell me you don't, tell me you don't know<br>
                          all the pain, all the things you're capable of</p>

                          <p>Well I was bitter, I'll admit;<br>
                          counting down the days until I got over it<br>
                          just to think I never will<br>
                          It was too long wasting time -<br>
                          clearing your way and somehow losing mine<br>
                          It was never fair to me</p>

                          <p>What does it say about my self worth<br>
                          that I never put myself first?</p>

                          <p>Well I have grown much more than before<br>
                          you wouldn't know<br>
                          but I don't owe anything to you<br>
                          It was my choice, and I'm moving on<br>
                          it's the best possible thing left to do.<br>
                          There's still life after you.</p>

                          <p>It was a slow transition - I guess I admire that<br>
                          the stealth, the slow eclipse, indoctrination at it's best<br>
                          a graceful shame, but darling I bet you're proud of it<br>
                          I've never felt so wrong, and waking up has left me stronger<br>
                          snap to stifling, I won't be fooled here any longer<br>
                          Congratulations though - hindsight's still a worse bitch than you</p>

                          <p>What does it say about my self worth<br>

                          I couldn't see my worst decisions<br>
                          would rip me up and tear me at the seams<br>
                          that couldn't be<br>

                          Would it gain me any more love?<br>
                          Would I still feel righteous indignation if it<br>
                          made me what you want<br>
                          Would it give me any satisfaction?<br>

                          <p>What a double standard<br>
                          what a lonely, twisted frame of mind<br>
                          If your love comes with conditions<br>
                          what makes it so better than mine?<br>
                          Should I really have to deal with you<br>

                          Did you even think of that at all?<br>
                          And I swear you'd feel the shame despite the way<br>
                          I'd live the lie you want<br>
                          Wouldn't bring me any satisfaction<br>
